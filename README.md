The folder `layout/` defines the site overall structure

# How to build
Make sure that you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. 
If you are using ubuntu, you might want to use [that tutorial](https://nodesource.com/blog/chris-lea-joins-forces-with-nodesource)

The site files are generated in `build/`
