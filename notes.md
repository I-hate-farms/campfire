## Samples

### [Ceylon](http://ceylon-lang.org/)
 The navigation bar is nice and the presence of code let you 
 know what kind of language we are talking about ("you can breathe pal, 
 that's not some LISP/Haskell inspired stuff"). 

 The rest of the page is boring and bland (too many walls of text)
 
### [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/)
 Clean. 
 A bit too clean if you ask me: the main page doesn't give enough info.
 
### [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/)
 Very hipster. 
 The space above the fold is wasted I think: we are selling a language too dev/geeks not a chat app startup here.
 
### [Xtend](http://eclipse.org/xtend/ )
Content wise it has the proper balance I think. 

The presentation feels like 1999 though. 

### [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/)
Very hipster. 
But not bad.

## Jade and markdown hint
- try #[a(href="blah.html") my link]
- you could always just use :markdown instead 
of p and then type markdown for that paragraph
